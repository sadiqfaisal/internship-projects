# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project for detecting potentially fraudulent credit card transactions using data preprocessing, anomaly detection, and XGBoost classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a classification problem where the goal is to identify suspicious transactions while minimizing incorrect classifications of legitimate transactions.

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing
* Fraud and non-fraud class analysis
* Anomaly detection
* XGBoost model training
* Model evaluation
* Model serialization
* Fraud prediction application

The trained XGBoost model is integrated into an application that can be used to make fraud predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Explore and understand credit card transaction data.
2. Analyze the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
3. Preprocess transaction data for machine learning.
4. Investigate anomalous transaction patterns.
5. Train an XGBoost fraud detection model.
6. Evaluate the trained model.
7. Save the trained model for reuse.
8. Build an application for fraud prediction.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

The project begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the transaction dataset.

The analysis focuses on:

* Dataset structure
* Feature information
* Missing values
* Transaction characteristics
* Fraud and legitimate transaction distribution
* Data visualization

The class distribution is visualized in the generated report.

### Class Distribution

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The transaction data is processed and prepared for machine learning.

The preprocessing workflow prepares the input features and target variable for model training and prediction.

The feature information used by the trained model is stored in:

```text
models/feature_columns.pkl
```

---

### 3. Anomaly Detection

Fraudulent transactions can contain patterns that differ from normal transactions.

An anomaly detection stage is included to investigate unusual transaction behavior and provide an additional perspective on fraudulent activity.

The anomaly detection process is implemented in:

```text
notebooks/02_anomaly_detection.py
```

---

### 4. XGBoost Classification

The main supervised learning model used in this project is **XGBoost**.

XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm designed for efficient and accurate machine learning on structured data.

The model is trained using the processed transaction features and the corresponding fraud classification target.

The training process is implemented in:

```text
notebooks/03_train_xgboost.py
```

The trained model is saved as:

```text
models/xgboost_fraud_model.pkl
```

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using classification metrics and visual analysis.

The project includes a generated ROC curve:

### ROC Curve

The evaluation process can be found in:

```text
notebooks/03_train_xgboost.py
```

The model evaluation considers the performance of the fraud classification system rather than relying only on accuracy.
